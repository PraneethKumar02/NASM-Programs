# Netwide Assembler (NASM)

The Netwide Assembler, NASM, is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler designed for
portability and modularity. An assembler translates assembly code into machine code. Assembly code is NOT portable across architectures. Different ISAs(Instruction Set Architecture) have different assembly languages.

## Installation

Online NASM Compilers can be used for programming.

## Usage

As a programmer, assembly language is the closest you can go to a machine's CPU.

Assembly language is plain and transparent as compared to high-level languages, which are largely abstract data types. This is due to the fact that it only has a few operations. As a result, this is extremely useful for algorithm analysis, which includes both semantics and control flow. It is also easier to debug because it is less complex.
